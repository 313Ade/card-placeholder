# card-placeholder
Contains code for a card placeholder.  A little animation displays before the details of the card show up

This also contains code on how to create a card from scratch. The bootstrap cards can be kinda annoying.
The image is fetched from an API. <br/>
CSS for animation, JS for the delay.
